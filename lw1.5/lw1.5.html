                <h2>Oak</h2>
                <p>
                    Oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately
                    500 extant species of oaks. The common name "oak" also appears in the names of species in related
                    genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea
                    robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern
                    Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical
                    latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number
                    of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species
                    of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains
                    approximately 100 species.
